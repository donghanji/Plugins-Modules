Plugins Modules

===============

PM(Plugins Modules) follows the CommonJS specification and it is based on the browser-side Javascript to carry out its portion of Modules. Plugins Modules is available under the terms of the [MIT License].

The aims of PM are that taking modules as the core to form a powerful plug-in library. It contains three aspects of plugin, they are: Mobile, Pad and Wed. So the PM is not a frame of my own, but a frame shared by all of us.

Everything is just to begin.

The future of the PM, you and I, we us grow together ... ...


=================
PM(Plugins Modules)，遵循CommonJS规范，基于浏览器端Javascript实现其Modules部分。您可以按照MIT开源协议使用该框架。

PM的目标是以Modules作为核心，形成一个强大的插件库，包含Mobile、Pad和Web三方面的插件，所以PM 不能是一个只属于我个人的框架，PM要成为一个大家共同拥有的框架。

一切，方才伊始。

PM的未来，有你，有我，我们一同成长……
